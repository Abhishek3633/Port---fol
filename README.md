Hey! I'm Abhishek Singh Baghel, a Data Engineer based in India with a passion for turning raw, messy data into reliable, scalable pipelines that actually power real decisions.

I specialize in building ETL/ELT pipelines, working with distributed systems using Apache Spark, and deploying cloud workflows on AWS & GCP. I care deeply about data quality, clean architecture, and automation.

Beyond data engineering, I'm actively exploring the world of Generative AI development — experimenting with LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI-powered tooling to stay ahead of the curve.
